    <!-- HOME TIPS -->
    <string-array name="home_tips">
        <item>Describing data | When exploring research data, having access to information regarding their production circumstances is of utmost importance. While basic datasets are easily understood without such information, the same doesn\'t happen if we consider modern research workflows. To overcome this barrier, it is advisable to provide information that can help third parties fully understand how these datasets were produced, which research institutions were involved along with other relevant aspects. \n\n With an improved data description, we can achieve higher reuse rates, higher chances of data being preserved on the long run, and create mechanisms that help validating published research.</item>
        <item>LabTablet | In some cases, researchers are already describing their data in a systematic approach, even without noticing it. They often resort to paper-based laboratory notebooks to do so which, as you can understand, can be a frail support for such an important asset. LabTablet is designed to quickly gather important insights about research data. It is similar to an electronic laboratory notebook, offering diverse digital support for all kinds of descriptions. Text-based notes can be a good starting point, but LabTablet can use the integrated sensors to automatically record the available information.</item>
        <item>Taking advantage of built-in sensors | <p>LabTablet can read the device\'s built-in sensors, provided you find them useful. The available sources are entirely dependent on the platform, but it is quite common to find devices with:</p>\n  &#8226; GPS<br/>\n  &#8226; Temperature<br/>\n  &#8226; Luminosity<br/>\n  &#8226; Magnetic field<br/>\n  &#8226; Other proprietary sensors<br/> <p>For quick memos, for instance, you can make short voice recordings that you can later translate into other formats. This feature can also be used if you look forward to record an interview or any other event that you feel should be kept. With this in mind, LabTablet lets you record from these sources:</p>" +
